<h3>Louie's Last Poker Run</h3>

Louie's Last Regatta has raised over $1,088,000 for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin since 1999.  Children's is ranked number four in the nation - number one in preemie and newborn care and number three in emergency care by Parent's Magazine.  Louie's is working hard toward that second million raised with the 16th Last Regatta and 2nd Last Poker Run this year!<br>
