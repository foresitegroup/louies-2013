<h3>Louie's 18th Last Regatta</h3>

Louie's Last Regatta has raised over $1,088,000 for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin since 1999.  Children's is ranked number four in the nation - number one in preemie and newborn care and number three in emergency care by Parent's Magazine.  Louie's is working hard toward that second million raised with the 18th Last Regatta this year!<br>
