  <strong>Maggie Bersch Cup</strong><br>
  Maggie Bersch was diagnosed with leukemia when she was three years old. Her battle with cancer and the quality of the care she and her family received at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin was the inspiration for the event's relationship with the hospital. Her story become a part of Louie's fundraising as Maggie's father, Denny, provided an annual update on her treatments at Children's Hospital. After Maggie passed away in 2004 at age eight, a trophy in Maggie's honor was dedicated and was awarded to the top fundraiser at Louie's. The Maggie Bersch Cup continues that tradition. Winning the Maggie Bersch Cup as the top fundraiser is the most prized honor at Louie's.

  <strong>Louie's Last Cup</strong><br>
  The dented and scuffed cup is the Louie's Last Cup. This trophy is awarded to the first place boat in the actual race. Legend has it that this may have been the drinking vessel that was bashed over Uncle Louie's head back in 1886 ultimately leading to his demise. The truth is that the cup was repeatedly bashed into a parking meter out in front of the trophy store the day it was purchased. We wanted a distressed look to it....

  The large fish is called The Flounder (commissioned in 2005). It is awarded to the boat with the longest elapsed time around the marks (last stinking place). The winner of the Flounder epitomizes the good natured attitude of the event.

  <strong>The Debbia Grassroots Trophy</strong><br>
  In an effort to recognize the hard work that many Louie's sailors exert to raise small donations from a large number of family and friends, but never get to the level of dollars that would win the Maggie Bersch Cup, Louie's introduced the Grassroots Cup in 2012. The winner of the Grassroots Cup is the boat that raises the greatest number of individual donors of over $15. The first winner of the Grassroots Cup, Mike Kenny's Debbia, earned the right to have the trophy named honor of their boat.
